Description: This file contains the data model detailing the properties of the various game objects. This is intended to be
a guideline for creating level data in JSON format. The map is the top-level object containing all of the other objects in a
given level, arranged into layers of like objects. The map contains a given number of tiles, which contain the ground and 
scenery layers. The next layer is the buildings layer, containing startTerminus, endTerminus, station, and signalBox objects. 
Above the buildings layer is the track layer, which contains track and branchTrack objects. The topmost layer of the map 
contains the trains with both trainEngine and trainCar objects.
