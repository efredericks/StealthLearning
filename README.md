# Stealth Learning

This project aims to teach K-12 students basic Computer Science concepts via a game that was designed first and foremost to be fun.  To that end we introduce *Stealth Learning,* an approach that will help students learn via gaming.  We designed stealth learning based on prior experiences with games that were and were not intended to be educational to design

**TrainFlow** is the first project that implements stealth learning.  This game aims to teach basic program flow, including branching conditions, data manipulation, and trace debugging via a fun and intuitive game that has the player routing a train from start to destination, selecting stations along the way to impact the train's payload (i.e., its data buffer).  It is implemented using HTML5, JavaScript, and PHP.
